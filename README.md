# Description

- We first generate the list of all graphs with twenty vertices 
such that in those graphs, there is a vertex v0 with nine neighborhoord and the other vertices is either 
a neighborhood of v0 or neighborhoord of its neigborhoord.
- Then we generate the Schur decompositions of each graph
- We finally generate all partitions $ \lambda $ in the chromatic function of the graphs with negative coefficients in Schur decomposition.
